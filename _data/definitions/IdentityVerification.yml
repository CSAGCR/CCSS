description: >
  Identity verification is a tiered process by which an organization or system attempts to confirm the authenticity of an [actors'](#actor) claim to be a given individual or organization.
  
  
  Typical methods of identity verification for individuals include:  
    - one or more forms of government-issued identification (driver's license, passport, etc.)  
    - one or more proofs of residency at the individual's home (utility bills, bank statements, etc.)  
    - successful completion of challenge questions through a reputable identity-verification service operating in the individual's country of residence (e.g. Equifax)
  

  In cases of an organization, the supporting records can include:
    - Employer Identification Number ("EIN"), Business Number, or similar identifier based on jurisdiction
    - D-U-N-S Number 
    - Articles of Incorporation

  In either case, enough supporting documentation should be provided and verified to support the actor's identity claim.
